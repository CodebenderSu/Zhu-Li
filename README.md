## Inactive
This project is currently inactive as I became busy with moving and have since gotten interested working on a couple other things. I plan to come back to working on this bot at a later date TBD.

## About
Zhu Li is a bot named after the Legend of Korra character by the same name. Like its namesake, it is designed to act as an assistant to Discord server owners and staff. Currently, it isn't capable of much, but I'm planning to add the following features:

* Custom command creation
* Quiz maker

## Dependencies
Zhu Li is built on NPM and Node using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/). 

## How to Use It
1. Open up "auth.json" in a text editor and change the Token value to that of your personal bot (many a guide how to find this by way of Google search). Save.
2. In the command line/shell, navigate to the folder containing the bot ("cd SomeDirectory", ect.).
3. Type "npm i". Wait for it to finish.
4. Type "node Bot.js". Bot will show as online with a checkpoint being logged in the console. The bot is now online.
5. To take the bot offline, type CTRL+C in the command line.
